# Chat App With Firebase

<p>
This is a project that was developed using Dart, Flutter and Firebase.
<br>
This project was developed to improve my knowledge of Firebase so I could get the job I am currently working for (2024/2).
<br>
<br> 
I developed this application over a weekend following a tutorial, where I learned how the Firebase database structure and its operations work.
<br> 
This application is very simple with a basic login system and a chat where you can view all users listed in the database. I confess that I have used it personally hahah, it works!  

<br>
Feel free to send questions, criticisms and suggestions, if you have any ideas to improve the code you are welcome!

## Prerequisites
<p>
Make sure you have Flutter, Dart, NODE, NPM and Git installed on your system.
</p>
<br>
<p>
You will also have to initialize the backend mentioned above before doing the step by step here.
</p>
<br>
<p>
It turns out that for you to be able to run it, you will need me to authorize your IP within the database, for that you can contact me.
